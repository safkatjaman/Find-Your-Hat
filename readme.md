#                             Find Your Hat

---
>>> This is a class based project. In this project, I have built an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field. To run the code you have to download it and you should have **node.js** installed in your machine. After downloading the project please run the below command
---

```
node find-your-hat.js
```
